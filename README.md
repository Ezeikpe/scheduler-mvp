Welcome to my Scheduler MVP  project

Scheduler “MVP specification”


Architecture

The minimum viable product (MVP) for the Scheduler program would typically include the essential features that allow users to create, manage, and complete tasks. Here are some key features that should be included in an MVP for the Scheduler program:

1. Task creation: Users should be able to create new tasks with a title and description.

2. Task management: Users should be able to view and edit their tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them.

3. Prioritization: Users should be able to assign priorities to tasks, such as high, medium, or low.

4. Due dates: Users should be able to assign due dates to tasks, and view their tasks in a calendar view.

5. Reminders: Users should be able to set reminders for important tasks that they need to complete.

6. Categories and tags: Users should be able to organize their tasks by assigning categories and tags to them.

7. Search: Users should be able to search for tasks by keyword, category, or tag.

By including these essential features, I will be creating a basic Scheduler program that provides value to users. As I receive feedback from users, I can continue to refine and improve the program.
